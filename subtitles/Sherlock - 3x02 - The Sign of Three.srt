1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
They just walked out of there!

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,240
Yeah, I know,
I was sort of sitting next to you.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,560
The whole Waters family.
They just walked right out of there!

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,240
Again, I was in the room.
How do they always manage that?!

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,680
They're good.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,480
They're greedy
and they'll do it again,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,760
and next time we're going to
catch them in the act.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
How?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,320
No good?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,400
They always know we're coming.
How do they always know?!

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,720
They're good, they work at it.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,280
They're never going to stop.
Well, neither are we.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,720
Argh!

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Argh!

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,320
Argh! AARGH!

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
Oh! Greg...

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,160
In the act!

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,320
It's the only way we're going to
do this, in the act!

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
They're still blocking it?

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,440
Yeah. Very efficiently hacked.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
They must be bloody pleased
with themselves.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
They must be.

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,400
Right then?

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,880
Ah, no! No, you've got to make
the arrest. This one's yours, boss.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
You've never called me boss before.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh, well, look what happens
when you're good.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,680
You know how most days
aren't good days?

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,921
This is a good day. Not
for the Waters family.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,960
OK, ten men on the roof,
all exits covered.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,560
The bank's closed, so we've
no hostages to worry about.

31
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
Sorry, no, go on. Go on.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,001
Um, we've got the tunnel
entrance covered...

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,680
...and Davies, Willow and Christie

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,961
are heading up armed
response on Mafeking Road.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
Sorry, I'd better get this.
It's him, isn't it?

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
I, I, I have to go. What?!

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
You make the arrest. No way!

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
Sorry, you'll be fine.
I'm cool with this.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,400
Jones will get all the credit
if you leave now, you know he will.

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah, well, yeah, it doesn't matter,
I have to go.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,520
Back up! I need maximum back up!

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Baker Street now!

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
What's going on?!

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
This is hard. What?

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,480
Really hard.
Hardest thing I've ever had to do.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Do you know any funny stories
about John?

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
What?!

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
I need anecdotes.
Didn't go to any trouble, did you?

49
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
Shut up, Mrs Hudson.
I haven't said a word.

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,760
You're formulating a question,

51
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,240
it's physically painful
watching you think.

52
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
I thought it was you playing.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,320
It was me playing.

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
I am composing.

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
You were dancing.

56
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,680
I was road-testing.

57
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,880
You what?

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,720
Why are you here?

59
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm bringing you your morning tea.
You're not usually awake.

60
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
You bring me tea in the morning?

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,760
Well, where do you think
it came from?

62
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
I don't know.
I just thought it sort of happened.

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,800
Your mother has a lot to answer for.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
Hmm, I know. I have a list.

65
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
Mycroft has a file.

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,600
So, it's the big day then.

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,760
What big day?

68
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,320
The wedding! John and Mary
getting married.

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,160
Two people who currently live
together are about to attend church,

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,040
have a party, go on a short holiday,
then carry on living together.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,320
What's big about that?
It changes people, marriage.

72
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
Hmm, no it doesn't.

73
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Well, you wouldn't understand,
cos you always live alone.

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Your husband was executed
for double murder.

75
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,640
You're hardly an advert
for companionship.

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,360
Marriage changes you as a person
in ways that you can't imagine.

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
As does lethal injection.

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,320
My best friend, Margaret,
she was my chief bridesmaid,

79
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,680
we were going to be best friends
forever, we always said that,

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,400
but I hardly saw her after that.

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
Aren't there usually biscuits?
I've run out. Have the shops?

82
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
She cried the whole day, saying,
"Ooh, it's the end of an era."

83
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm sure the shop
on the corner is open.

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,200
She was probably right, really.
I remember she left early.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,400
I mean, who leaves a wedding early?
So sad.

86
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,760
Hmm. Anyway, you've got
things to do.

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,840
No, not really. I've got plenty of
time to get ready... Biscuits!

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Oh! I really am going to
have a word with your mother.

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,520
You can if you like,
she understands very little.

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,280
Right then.

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Into battle.

92
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,840
Congratulations!

93
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,720
OK, hold it there, I want to get
this shot of the newlyweds.

94
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,160
Er, just the bride and groom,
please.

95
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,000
Sherlock...
Oh, sorry.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,520
OK, three, two, one, cheese.

97
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,640
The famous Mr Holmes.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
But no sex, OK? Sorry?!

99
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,240
You don't have to look so scared,
I'm only messing.

100
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,880
Bridesmaid, best man,
it's a bit traditional.
